### Overview
We chose to create this specific application because the world is going through an unprecedented health crisis that has forced many of us to be self quarantined at home. This quarantine does not mean that socialization should end, there should be a virtual escape. Quarantine Escape will allow users to get out virtually and connect with other users while also doing their part to slow the spread of the Coronavirus.

### Lessons Learned

- Learned how to work as a group completely remote, so we relied heavily on communication through Zoom meetings, Slack, and keeping our Trello board as up to date as possible. We always made sure to have a meeting in the morning and afternoon so we could have a proper azimuth check.

- Learned to plan a wireframe using Figma which was extremely helpful considering the remote constraints that we were under.
